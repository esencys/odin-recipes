  <strong>Description</strong>
  <p>
    I don't know where I got this recipe, but I have been using it for well over
    20 years. Works well in a slow cooker.
  </p>
  <strong>Ingredients</strong>
  <span>Original recipe yields 8 servings but this is for 2.</span>
  <ul>
    <li>2 1&frasl;2 tablespoons and 1&frasl;2 teaspoon water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons uncooked white rice</li>
    <li>2 cabbage leaves</li>
    <li>1&frasl;4 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped onion</li>
    <li>1&frasl;4 egg, slightly beaten</li>
    <li>1&frasl;4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>5&frasl;8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1&frasl;4 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Directions</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce
      heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.

      Bring a large, wide sauceppan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add
      cabbage leaves and cook for 2 to 4 minutes or until softened; drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, 1 cup cooked rice,
      onion, egg, salt, and pepper, along with 2 tablespoons of tomato soup. Mix
      thoroughly.

    <li>
      Divide the beef mixture evenly among the cabbage leaves. Roll and secure
      them with toothpicks or string.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a large skillet over medium heat, place the cabbage rolls and pour the
      remaining tomato soup over the top. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat
      to low and simmer for about 40 minutes, stirring and basting with the
      liquid often.
